        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p style="font-size: larger">
            I currently am working as a UX Engineer at GoDaddy, which is where my passion for design and development converge. See my previous work history on LinkedIn. Outside of work I have a beautiful wife and cat (obviously). I am also working on a few side projects including Investment Calculator (a simple tool to teach people about investing) and dayofthedead.holiday. Currently I am not accepting freelance work, but I'd love to get coffee and get to know you, so donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch.

        <h4>Front End Development</h4>
        <p style="font-size: larger">
            Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website. Using HTML, CSS , and Javascript, I build fast, interactive websites. This also may include integrating a CMS.
