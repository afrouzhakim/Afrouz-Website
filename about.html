        I am a Front-End Developer with producing high quality responsive websites. I take great care to ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable so you can enhance a website as your company grows.
I now specialize in Front-End development but my knowledge of multiple fields allows me to work on a project with the full scope in mind; simplifying the process of our working together and producing a more cohesive experience for your users.
I can quickly and efficiently join your team using continuous-integration with methods and tools such as Git and Agile(Scrum).
In some projects, my client’s require the ability to manage the content of their website. WordPress is the world’s most popular content management system which I have many 4 years of experience with.
